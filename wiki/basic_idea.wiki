Toshlcd is a module to let you change _easily_ the brigtness of your Toshiba laptops. There  are two ways to install toshlcd. If you are on a Debian-based distro, I would recommend you to install the module via the Debian packages. Else, you can compile from source toshlcd and install it.


Once toshlcd is installed you will have to execute `echo n > /proc/toshlcd` (where _n_ is a number between 0 and 7 (inclusively)), to change the lcd brightness. Or more easily, if you installed toshlcd script (which is automatically installed when using the Debian-based distro instructions), you will have to execute `toshlcd n`. Or to increment or decrement by one : `toshlcd inc` and `toschlcd dec`.
